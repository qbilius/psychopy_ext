v0.5.2
--------
* NEW: A prototype of Analyzer for an interactive data analysis! (undocumented; you can try it with ``import psychopy_ext.analyzer; psychopy_ext.analyzer.run())
* NEW: MouseRespGroup for mouse response displays.
* NEW: Error bars and confidence intervals for repeated measures using Loftus & Masson (1994).
* NEW: GridSpec support in plot.
* FIXED: Installation requirements are more loose now. Pure Python packages are installed on the go with pip. Non-pure required Python packages stop installation and tell you what to install manually. Non-pure recommended Python packages allow you to install psychopy_ext but give a warning about what's missing. Also, tries to complain about missing dependencies only when you explicitly need them.
* CHANGED: Info parameter now has 'repository' parameter instead of 'register' and 'push'. You can choose to either 'commit and push' (default) or 'only commit'. This should be more transparent. Moreover, exp.Experiment.run_exp() has been changes such that the whole committing and pushing thing occurs in the exp.Experiment.after_exp().
* CHANGED: keyword 'unstack' in ``stats.aggregate()`` is now 'unstacked' because of the new ``stats.unstack()`` function
* FIXED: In older PsychoPy versions, BaseVisualStim is _BaseVisualStim, so now accepting both.
* IMPROVED: last_keypress now always returns a list (that might be empty)
* IMPROVED: can call a custom method for analyzing fMRI data
* FIXED: Plotting and stats are more robust now.
* FIXED: compactibility with pandas 0.13+ (FrozenList issues and interactive plots causing no display)

v0.5.1.1
--------
* FIXED: mouse inherited from Exp to Task
* DEMOS: updated post_trial syntax

v0.5.1
------
* NEW: Experimental support for mouse inputs (with a demo)
* NEW: Experimental support for exporting displays to SVG (Circle, Line, Rect, ShapeStim, TextStim, ThickShapeStim)
* NEW: demo of the shortest  fully functional experiment possible
* FIXED: ThickLineStim can now accept default units for lineWidth
* FIXED: reoder
* ADDED: testing for demos
* FIXED: exp seed creation. Should now reinitialize seeds for each task and for each block.
* FIXED: GUI auto fit to contents in no size passed
* ADDED: write time stamp of the stat and finish of the experiment
* ADDED: psychopy_ext version in log
* FIXED: registering was not implemented even though Experiment was already using it
* FIXED: trial number printed at the begining, not at the end of the trial
* FIXED: GroupStim now properly converts stimuli to list
